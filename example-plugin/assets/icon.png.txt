This file represents a plugin icon placeholder.
In a real implementation, this would be a PNG image file (icon.png).

For the GitHub Actions workflow to work, you would need to:
1. Create a 48x48 or 96x96 PNG icon
2. Name it icon.png
3. Place it in the assets/ directory

For now, we'll create a simple 1x1 transparent PNG as a placeholder.
